# tsuserver3 Origin

A Python based server for Attorney Online.

Requires Python 3.6+.

## Motivation
Over the years, the original [tsuserver3](https://github.com/AttorneyOnlineVidya/tsuserver3) has been changed by various people and the codebase
has been inflated to the point where making any sort of change created a bigger mess than before.

Therefore *tsuserver3 Origin* aims to keep the old codebase simple and extend the code reasonably
while keeping it simple to add new features.


## How to use

* Rename `config_sample` to `config` and edit the values to your liking.  
* Run by using `start_server.py`. It's recommended that you use a separate virtual environment.
